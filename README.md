# Weather-Forcast-GUI-application
GUI application which uses a weather API to display weather information when city name or coordinates of city is provided.

Created this GUI application using tkinter library in python. 

I used openweathermap API for getting weather information.

'weather-icons.ipynb' loads some weather icons from openweathermap website and saves icons images in 'img' folder. This weather icons will be used at the time of displaying weather information.

'WeatherForcast.ipynb' contains the code of GUI aplication.
